# TODO

1. Test suite
1. connect RECORD_START_PAT and TIME_FORMAT to properly leverage custom dates
1. date search (on, before, after, last week, last 7 days, ...)
    - Resolve partially via plain regex search on the date fields 
        - ie '^2018-(0[7-9]|10)' for July-October of 2018
1. `jrnl_entry_search`: The last-line entry fails to match if it's a one-liner without a following newline. Presently place a new line "after" each entry.
1. time-report: a bit slow for an expansive time range

# RESOLVED

1. `jrnl_entry_edit`
    - two identical timestamps create a problem when an edited entry matches them
	- FIXED - leverage entire header line to denote the record, having escaped certain troublesome characters
